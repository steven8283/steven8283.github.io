              Charlotte Brontë’s romantic gothic novel, featuring one of

          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p class="content">
          With her 1847 novel, Jane Eyre, Charlotte Brontë created one of the
          most unforgettable heroines of all time. Jane Eyre is an orphan,
          penniless and plain, but full of courage and spirit. She has endured
          incredible hardship to secure her humble status as a governess in the
          household of her brooding employer, Mr. Rochester. Jane’s sharp wit
          and defiant nature meet with Rochester’s sardonic temperament. The two
          become enmeshed in a deep, intense bond. But Rochester has a terrible
          secret—a remnant from his past that could threaten any hope of
          happiness with his only love.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          An unconventional love story that broadened the scope of romantic
          fiction, Jane Eyre is ultimately the tale of one woman’s fight to
          claim her independence and self-respect in a society that has no place
          for her.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Jane Eyre calls into question most of society's major institutions,
          including education, family, social class, and Christianity. The novel
          asks the reader to consider a variety of contemporary social and
          political issues: What is women's position in society, what is the
          relation between Britain and its colonies, how important is artistic
          endeavor in human life, what is the relationship of dreams and fantasy
          to reality, and what is the basis of an effective marriage? Although
          the novel poses all of these questions, it doesn't didactically offer
          a single answer to any of them. Readers can construct their own
          answers, based on their unique and personal analyses of the book. This
          multidimensionality makes Jane Eyre a novel that rewards multiple
          readings.

            who dislike her. As the novel progresses, she grows in strength. She
            distinguishes herself at Lowood School because of her hard work and
            strong intellectual abilities. As a governess at Thornfield, she
            learns of the pleasures and pains of love through her relationship

            Jane Eyre is a young orphan being raised by Mrs. Reed, her cruel,
            wealthy aunt. A servant named Bessie provides Jane with some of the
            few kindnesses she receives, telling her stories and singing songs
            to her. One day, as punishment for fighting with her bullying cousin
            John Reed, Jane’s aunt imprisons Jane in the red-room, the room in
            which Jane’s Uncle Reed died. While locked in, Jane, believing that
            she sees her uncle’s ghost, screams and faints. She wakes to find
            herself in the care of Bessie and the kindly apothecary Mr. Lloyd,
            who suggests to Mrs. Reed that Jane be sent away to school. To
            Jane’s delight, Mrs. Reed concurs.

            Once at the Lowood School, Jane finds that her life is far from
            idyllic. The school’s headmaster is Mr. Brocklehurst, a cruel,
            hypocritical, and abusive man. Brocklehurst preaches a doctrine of
            poverty and privation to his students while using the school’s funds
            to provide a wealthy and opulent lifestyle for his own family. At
            Lowood, Jane befriends a young girl named Helen Burns, whose strong,
            martyr like attitude toward the school’s miseries is both helpful
            and displeasing to Jane.

            A massive typhus epidemic sweeps Lowood, and Helen dies of
            consumption. The epidemic also results in the departure of Mr.
            Brocklehurst by attracting attention to the insalubrious conditions
            at Lowood. After a group of more sympathetic gentlemen takes
            Brocklehurst’s place, Jane’s life improves dramatically. She spends
            eight more years at Lowood, six as a student and two as a teacher.

            After teaching for two years, Jane yearns for new experiences. She
            accepts a governess position at a manor called Thornfield, where she
            teaches a lively French girl named Adèle. The distinguished
            housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax presides over the estate. Jane’s employer
            at Thornfield is a dark, impassioned man named Rochester, with whom
            Jane finds herself falling secretly in love. She saves Rochester
            from a fire one night, which he claims was started by a drunken
            servant named Grace Poole. But because Grace Poole continues to work
            at Thornfield, Jane concludes that she has not been told the entire
            story.

            Jane sinks into despondency when Rochester brings home a beautiful
            but vicious woman named Blanche Ingram. Jane expects Rochester to
            propose to Blanche. But Rochester instead proposes to Jane, who
            accepts almost disbelievingly. The wedding day arrives, and as Jane
            and Mr. Rochester prepare to exchange their vows, the voice of Mr.
            Mason cries out that Rochester already has a wife. Mason introduces
            himself as the brother of that wife—a woman named Bertha. Mr. Mason
            testifies that Bertha, whom Rochester married when he was a young
            man in Jamaica, is still alive. Rochester does not deny Mason’s
            claims, but he explains that Bertha has gone mad. He takes the
            wedding party back to Thornfield, where they witness the insane
            Bertha Mason scurrying around on all fours and growling like an
            animal. Rochester keeps Bertha hidden on the third story of
            Thornfield and pays Grace Poole to keep his wife under control.
            Bertha was the real cause of the mysterious fire earlier in the
            story. Knowing that it is impossible for her to be with Rochester,
            Jane flees Thornfield.

            Penniless and hungry, Jane is forced to sleep outdoors and beg for
            food. At last, three siblings who live in a manor alternatively
            called Marsh End and Moor House take her in. Their names are Mary,
            Diana, and St. John (pronounced “Sinjin”) Rivers, and Jane quickly
            becomes friends with them. St. John is a clergyman, and he finds
            Jane a job teaching at a charity school in Morton. He surprises her
            one day by declaring that her uncle, John Eyre, has died and left
            her a large fortune: 20,000 pounds. When Jane asks how he received
            this news, he shocks her further by declaring that her uncle was
            also his uncle: Jane and the Riverses are cousins. Jane immediately
            decides to share her inheritance equally with her three newfound
            relatives.

            St. John decides to travel to India as a missionary, and he urges

            refuses to marry her cousin because she does not love him. St. John
            pressures her to reconsider, and she nearly gives in. However, she
            realizes that she cannot abandon forever the man she truly loves
            when one night she hears Rochester’s voice calling her name over the
            moors. Jane immediately hurries back to Thornfield and finds that it
            has been burned to the ground by Bertha Mason, who lost her life in
            the fire. Rochester saved the servants but lost his eyesight and one
            of his hands. Jane travels on to Rochester’s new residence,
            Ferndean, where he lives with two servants named John and Mary.

            perfect equality in their life together. She says that after two
            years of blindness, Rochester regained sight in one eye and was able
            to behold their first son at his birth.

            Charlotte Brontë worked as a teacher and governess before
            collaborating on a book of poetry with her two sisters, Emily and
            Anne, who were writers as well. In 1847, Brontë published the
            semi-autobiographical novel Jane Eyre, which was a hit and would
            become a literary classic. Her other novels included Shirley and
            Villette. She died on March 31, 1855, in Haworth, Yorkshire,
            England.

            Brontë was born on April 21, 1816, in Thornton, Yorkshire, England.
            Said to be the most dominant and ambitious of the Brontës, Charlotte
            was raised in a strict Anglican home by her clergyman father and a
            religious aunt after her mother and two eldest siblings died. She
            and her sister Emily attended the Clergy Daughter's School at Cowan
            Bridge but were largely educated at home. Though she tried to earn a
            living as both a governess and a teacher, Brontë missed her sisters
            and eventually returned home.

            A writer all her life, Brontë published her first novel, Jane Eyre,
            in 1847 under the manly pseudonym Currer Bell. Though controversial
            in its criticism of society's treatment of impoverished women, the
            book was an immediate hit. She followed the success with Shirley in
            1848 and Villette in 1853.

            <strong>Jane Eyre-- </strong>novel by Charlotte Brontë, first
            published in 1847 as Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, with Currer Bell
            (Brontë’s pseudonym) listed as the editor. Widely considered a
            classic, it gave new truthfulness to the Victorian novel with its
            realistic portrayal of the inner life of a woman, noting her
            struggles with her natural desires and social condition.

          <br />
          <div class="content">
            Written as a first-person narrative, the novel follows the plain but
            intelligent Jane Eyre in her development as an individual from her
            traumatic childhood. Brontë describes five specific stages of Jane's
            growth over the course of the novel: first, her childhood among
            oppressive relatives; second, her time as a student at Lowood
            School; third, her months as a governess at Thornfield Manor;
            fourth, her time with her cousins at Marsh's End; and finally, her
            return to Thornfield Manor and marriage to Mr. Rochester. As a
            classic example of the Germanic Bildungsroman, or novel of
            formation, the text demonstrates Jane's attempts to define her
            identity against forces of opposition in each of these five stages.

            <strong>Shirley-- </strong>is a classic historical novel by
            Charlotte Brontë. Written in 1849 after the overwhelming success of
            Jane Eyre, the book follows two women from very different social
            circles who show their communities what women are capable of. The
            book is generally regarded as Brontë’s most feminist novel, and it
            is still widely read today. Her biographer called it a
            “revolutionary” text. Charlotte Brontë was the eldest of the famous
            Brontë sisters, whose novels are among the highest-regarded in
            English literature. She was not in good health and died at only
            thirty-eight while carrying her unborn child.

            that the story of Villette was not as interesting as that of Jane
            Eyre. The book is not as often read as Jane Eyre, and many readers,
            even those who admire Brontë, have no idea she wrote more than one
            novel. Villette often languishes unread on library shelves, attended
            to only by graduate students or literary scholars.
